what is n/2 and square-root(n) ?
    
    n/2 => let n = 2m = m+m
        => 2m/2 
        => (m+m)/2
        => m/2 + m/2
        => m which mean one half of the number 2m

    square-root(n) => let n = m^2 = m*m = m+m+......+m-times = m added m times
                   => square-root(m^2) 
                   => square-root(m added m times)
                   => m
