## Steps to improve the performance of the algorithm

 1. Benchmark - Benchmark your code. Don't start without this
 2. Breakdown - Breakdown the benchmarks to smaller components to isolate costly part of code. Profiling can be really helpful here
 3. Optimise - Optimise the part of code that will lead to meaningful increase, start with low hanging fruits

## Compiler Optimizations

Three Major Compiler Optimizations :
* Machine Dependent
* Architecture Dependent
* Architecture Independent

## Code Optimizations

Caching and Memory locality - temporal and spatial locality

CPU Level parallelism

Reducing Instructions 
  * Loop Unrolling
  * Division vs Multiplication
  * Reducing Branching
