===========

Algo - 1: Latin String Splitting
--------------------------------

	Splitable - O(2^n)
	Memoization
	Data structure: Array-O(n^2)
	Figuring out Memorization Structure

---

Algo-2: Longest Increasing SubSequence
--------------------------------------

	**Methods to Solve:** Input(), Output(left to right)
	Remember some thing extra details - Last number up to now
	Greedy Algorithm
	Order of filling the 2d arrays
		1. outter loop from right to left
		2. Inner loop any order as there are no dependency in the same column
	Running Time: O(n^2)
