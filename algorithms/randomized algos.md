Randomized Algorithms

-> Quicksort

-> For Randomized Algorithms we considers max(E[T(x)]) worst case expected time.

Intro/review of discrete prob:

-> Sample space(omega) = Finite or countable set

-> Probability Mass Function: Pr: omega -> R

	-> Pr[w]=>0  -> sum(Pr[w]) = 1

-> Event = subset of omega = holding a condition or proposition

	Pr[A] = sum(Pr[w]) such that w belongs to A<= Prob of event

Eg: blue die + red die

	Sample Space = all possible combinations of the rolling the two dies

	Event = set of combinations with atmost one 5

	Pr[atmost one 5] = Pr[not(two 5s)] = 1-Pr[two 5s] = 35/36

Conditional Probability:

A,B are the event

Pr[A|B] => Probability of A given the Probability of B 

Pr[A|B] = Pr[and(A,B)] / P[B]

A and B are disjoint <=> Pr[and(A,B)] = 0

A and B are independent <=> Pr[and(A,B)] = Pr[A].Pr[B]
